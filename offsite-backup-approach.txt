# Offsite backups

 If udev rule is not enable (to automatically run a script on plugin) you can manually initiate the script with
`sudo bacula_offsite_udev add sdXY`, then the script will mount the hdd to your configured offsite mountpoint and create
the bareos jobs via ssh (from the client to the bareos dir) with bconsole. Each copy job creates multiple
jobs (for each backup) too. 

To get rid of old backups, clean the hdd before initiating new offsite backups. Approach like this:
(1) mount hdd with `sudo bacula_offsite_udev mount sdXY`
(2) run on the dir server `bacula_prune_all`, which will prune all volumes according to the retention times
    in the config.
(3) run `bacula_del_purged_vols` to finally remove purged vols (will work for remote sd's if ssh host is configured the
    same as in storages.conf
(4) unmount your offsite mountpoint with `sudo umount /mnt/8tb01`. Thats it, now you can precede with above offsite
    backup.


# Requirements:

The client where the offsite sd is needs the services bareos-sd and bareos-fd running and the bareos ports for those
services opened.


# Precautions:

- Make sure your hdd has enough space.
- Sometimes you need to restart the clients sd/fd and the servers dir/sd/fd to have the offsite hdd being recognized.
